## Key:

### STAN0128_main_OUTPUT.sav

This data refers to the survey about major events and public opinion done in Fall 2019. Refer to the codebook in docs. 

### mzip_month_smoke.RDS
This refers to the levels of smoke recorded per month. May be useful later. 

### frap_fire_perimiter_gis
This is a multi-agency statewide database of fire history. For CAL FIRE, timber fires 10 acres or greater, brush fires 30 acres and greater, and grass fires 300 acres or greater are included. For the USFS, there is a 10 acre minimum for fires since 1950.

This dataset contains wildfire history, prescribed burns and other fuel modification projects.

Includes separate groups for just large fires (5000+ acres) vs all fires, and a separate layer for Prescribed Burns. The All Fires group is scale dependent and starts displaying at 1:500,000 scale. Prescribed fires likewise begin displaying at 1:500,000 scale. Full labels included only for 2010+ Large Fires, Year-only labels for other large fires, and those all display starting at 1:500,000 scale. Only 2000s and 2010s large fires are on by default.

The data is updated annually with fire perimeters from the previous fire season. This service represents the latest official release, and is updated annually when a new version is released. As of June, 2019 it represents fire19_1.
